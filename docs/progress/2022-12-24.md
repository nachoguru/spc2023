# Day 2: 2022-12-24

## Goals For Today

 * organize docs
 * re-test Deploy-to-Supabase connection Postgres.js with TLS config settings suggested by helpful folks on Gitter
 * let one user (me) pick one stock for one contest using the IEX example search API

## Done So Far

 * break out ginormous README into a docs folder where daily progress notes like these can exist separately from any actual documentation.
 * share a few ideas with Deno / Supabase teams in README, including one massively self-serving idea
