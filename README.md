# Stock Picking Contest 2023

## (A Supabase Hackathon Joint)

...in which I use the looming deadline of the Supabase Hackathon to finally hammer out an MVP for a friend to manage [his annual Stock Picking Contest](http://everythingeven.com/2022spc.php) for the CEO.ca community. 

And if you're gonna make something to manage **one** SPC, why not make something to manage **ALL** the SPCs?

## MVP Goals:

First, to [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) :

 * using Github public repos (this is my first, sweet)
 * Deno
 * Deno Deploy
 * Fresh
 * Supabase
 * IEX Cloud / Apperate
 * embedding TradingView chart widget

Also to hopefully build something useful, to help others, uh, help other others, by showing that managing their own saving / investing / speculation can be fun.

Finally, to create an example for a few avowed non-programmers I know, to show that gluing together existing services is probably more productive than my usual approach of building and hosting everything myself.

## Non-Goals

 * anything to do with Node or NPM

## ToDo:

 * ~~create a public Github with a README and at least one meme~~
 * ???
 * profit!
 
 K enough text... gotta get to work.
